# Getting started

To use clangd, you need:

- clangd installed
- a plugin for your editor
- to tell clangd how your project is built

## Installing clangd

For best results, use the [most recent version](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/releases/latest) of clangd. 

You can check the version currently installed with `clangd --version`.

(Version numbers are based on LLVM. clangd 7 was the first usable release).

### Installing with a package manager

<details>
<summary markdown="span">Mac OS X</summary>
 
Clangd can be installed (along with LLVM) via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):
```
brew install llvm
```

or with [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/):

```
sudo port install clang-11
```

</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">Windows</summary>
Download the LLVM installer from [releases.llvm.org](http://releases.llvm.org/download.html)
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">Debian/Ubuntu</summary>
Installing the `clangd` package will usually give you a slightly older version.

Try to install a packaged release (12.0):

```bash
sudo apt-get install clangd-12
```

If that's not found, at least `clangd-9` or `clangd-8` should be available.
Versions before 8 were part of the `clang-tools` package.

This will install clangd as `/usr/bin/clangd-12`. Make it the default `clangd`:

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clangd clangd /usr/bin/clangd-12 100
```

</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">Other systems</summary>
Most distributions include clangd in a `clangd` package, in a `clang-tools`
package, or in the full `llvm` distribution.

For some platforms, binaries are also available at [releases.llvm.org](http://releases.llvm.org/download.html).
</details>

### Standalone .zip releases

You can also download binaries directly for macOS, windows, and Linux (x86-64):
[latest stable release](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/releases/latest).

If you live on the bleeding edge, snapshot pre-releases are built weekly and
available on the [github releases page](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/releases).

### Compiling from sources

You can find instructions in
[llvm-project](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/clang-tools-extra/clangd#building-and-testing-clangd).

## Editor plugins

clangd runs through [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), editors that
support LSP can communicate with clangd to provide features like code completion, diagnostics, go-to-definition, etc.
In principle clangd should work with any of them, though feature set and interface may vary.

Here are some plugins we know work well with clangd:

<details>
<summary markdown="span">Vim/Neovim</summary>
Vim and Neovim have several plugins that can communicate with clangd.

### YouCompleteMe

Supports both Vim and Neovim. Note that clangd support is not enabled by default in [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe),
you must install it with `install.py --clangd-completer`.

We recommend changing a couple of YCM's default settings. In `.vimrc` add:
```
" Let clangd fully control code completion
let g:ycm_clangd_uses_ycmd_caching = 0
" Use installed clangd, not YCM-bundled clangd which doesn't get updates.
let g:ycm_clangd_binary_path = exepath("clangd")
```

You should see errors highlighted and completions as you type.

![Code completion in YouCompleteMe](screenshots/ycm_completion.png)

YouCompleteMe supports many of clangd's features:

- code completion
- diagnostics and fixes (`:YcmCompleter FixIt`)
- find declarations, references, and definitions (`:YcmCompleter GoTo` etc)
- rename symbol (`:YcmCompleter RefactorRename`)

Under the hood:

- **Debug logs**: run `:YcmDebugInfo` to see clangd status, and `:YcmToggleLogs`
  to view clangd's debug logs.
- **Command-line flags**: Set `g:ycm_clangd_args` in `.vimrc`, e.g.:

  ```vim
  let g:ycm_clangd_args = ['-log=verbose', '-pretty']
  ```

- **Alternate clangd binary**: set `g:ycm_clangd_binary_path` in `.vimrc`.

### coc-clangd

Supports both Vim and Neovim. [coc-clangd](https://github.com/clangd/coc-clangd) is an extension for
[coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim), you need to [install coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Install-coc.nvim) first.

`:CocInstall coc-clangd` in Vim/Neovim to install coc-clangd. coc-clangd will try to find clangd from your `$PATH`,
if not found, run `:CocCommand clangd.install` to install the [latest release](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/releases/latest)
from GitHub, or set `clangd.path` in `:CocConfig` to use custom clangd binary.

coc-clangd provides configurations for clangd, you can set them in `:CocConfig`:

```json
{
  "clangd.path": "/path/to/custom/clangd",
  "clangd.arguments": ["--background-index", "--clang-tidy"],
  "clangd.fallbackFlags": ["-std=c++23"]
}
```

Check [coc-clangd's README](https://github.com/clangd/coc-clangd?tab=readme-ov-file#configurations) for more options.

coc-clangd also provides commands to interact with clangd:

- `:CocCommand clangd.switchSourceHeader`, switch between source/header files
- `:CocCommand clangd.symbolInfo`, resolve symbol info under the cursor
- `:CocCommand clangd.memoryUsage`, show memory usage
- `:CocCommand clangd.install`, install latest release from GitHub
- `:CocCommand clangd.update`, check and update clangd from GitHub

There are two ways to get request/response logs from coc-clangd:

1. Set `"clangd.trace.server": "verbose"` in `:CocConfig`, and check the output in `:CocCommand workspace.showOutput clangd`.
2. Set `"clangd.trace.file": "/tmp/clangd.log"`, clangd will output logs to the file.

### Neovim built-in LSP client

Neovim only. Neovim has a built-in LSP client, which can be configured to work with clangd.

1. install [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) with your plugin manager
2. enable clangd in your init.lua: `require'lspconfig'.clangd.setup{}`
3. you can pass additional arguments to clangd to trace logs or enable more features:

```lua
local lspconfig = require('lspconfig')
lspconfig.clangd.setup({
  name = 'clangd',
  cmd = {'clangd', '--background-index', '--clang-tidy', '--log=verbose'},
  initialization_options = {
    fallback_flags = { '-std=c++17' },
  },
})
```

You can also use [clangd_extensions.nvim](https://github.com/p00f/clangd_extensions.nvim) directly, with more off-spec features support.
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">Emacs</summary>
[eglot](https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot) can be configured to work with clangd.

Install eglot with `M-x package-install RET eglot RET`.

Add the following to `~/.emacs` to enable clangd:

```elisp
(require 'eglot)
(add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs '((c++-mode c-mode) "clangd"))
(add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure)
(add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure)
```

After restarting you should see diagnostics for errors in your code, and `M-x
completion-at-point` should work.

![Diagnostics in Emacs](screenshots/emacs_diagnostics.png)

eglot supports many of clangd's features, with caveats:

- code completion, enhanced by `company-mode`, see below
- diagnostics and fixes
- find definitions and references (`M-x xref-find-definitions` etc)
- hover and highlights
- code actions (`M-x eglot-code-actions`)

### company-mode

eglot does have basic integration with company-mode, which provides a more
fluent completion UI.

You can install it with `M-x package-install RET company RET`, and enable it
with `M-x company-mode`.

![Completion in company-mode](screenshots/emacs_company.png)

### Under the hood

- **Debug logs**: available in the `EGLOT events` buffer.
- **Command-line flags and alternate binary**: instead of adding `"clangd"`
  to `eglot-server-programs`, add `("/path/to/clangd" "-log=verbose")` etc.

<details>
<summary markdown="span">Visual Studio Code</summary>
The official extension is
[vscode-clangd](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd)
and can be installed from within VSCode.

Choose **View** --> **Extensions**, then search for "clangd". (Make sure
the Microsoft C/C++ extension is **not** installed).

After restarting, you should see red underlines underneath errors, and
you should get rich code completions including e.g. function parameters.

![Code completion in VSCode](screenshots/basic_completion.png)

vscode-clangd has excellent support for all clangd features, including:

- code completion
- diagnostics and fixes
- find declarations, references, and definitions
- find symbol in file (`Ctrl-P @foo`) or workspace (`Ctrl-P #foo`)
- hover and highlights
- code actions

### Under the hood

- **Debug logs**: when clangd is running, you should see "Clang Language Server"
  in the dropdown of the Output panel (**View** -> **Output**).
- **Command-line flags**: these can be passed in the `clangd.arguments` array
  in your `settings.json`. (**File** -> **Preferences** -> **Settings**).
- **Alternate clangd binary**: set the `clangd.path` string in `settings.json`.
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">Sublime Text</summary>
[tomv564/LSP](https://github.com/tomv564/LSP) works with clangd out of the box.

Select **Tools**-->**Install Package Control** (if you haven't installed it yet).

Press `Ctrl-Shift-P` and select **Package Control: Install Package**. Select
**LSP**.

Press `Ctrl-Shift-P` and select **LSP: Enable Language Server Globally**. Select
**clangd**.

Open a C++ file, and you should see diagnostics and completion:

![Completion in Sublime Text](screenshots/sublime_completion.png)

The LSP package has excellent support for all most clangd features, including:

- code completion (a bit noisy due to how snippets are presented)
- diagnostics and fixes
- find definition and references
- hover and highlights
- code actions

### Under the hood

Settings can be tweaked under **Preferences**-->**Package Settings**-->**LSP**.

- **Debug logs**: add `"log_stderr": true`
- **Command-line flags and alternate clangd binary**: inside the
  `"clients": {"clangd": { ... } }` section, add
  `"command": ["/path/to/clangd", "-log=verbose"]` etc.

</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">Other editors</summary>
There is a directory of LSP clients at [langserver.org](http://langserver.org).

A generic client should be configured to run the command `clangd`, and
communicate via the language server protocol on standard input/output.
</details>

If you don't have strong feelings about an editor, we suggest you try out
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), it has excellent language server
support and most faithfully demonstrates what clangd can do.

## Project setup

To understand your source code, clangd needs to know your build flags.
(This is just a fact of life in C++, source files are not self-contained).

By default, clangd will assume your code is built as `clang some_file.cc`,
and you'll probably get spurious errors about missing `#include`d files, etc.
There are a couple of ways to fix this.

### `compile_commands.json`

This file provides compile commands for every source file in a project.
It is usually generated by tools.

clangd will look in the parent directories of the files you edit looking for it,
and also in subdirectories named `build/`.
For example, if editing `$SRC/gui/window.cpp`, we search in `$SRC/gui/`,
`$SRC/gui/build/`, `$SRC/`, `$SRC/build/`, ...

<details>
<summary markdown="span">CMake-based projects</summary>
If your project builds with CMake, it can generate this file. You should enable
it with:

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1
```

`compile_commands.json` will be written to your build directory.
If your build directory is `$SRC` or `$SRC/build`, clangd will find it.
Otherwise, symlink or copy it to `$SRC`, the root of your source tree.

```bash
ln -s ~/myproject-build/compile_commands.json ~/myproject/
```
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">Bazel-based projects</summary>
Bazel can generate this file via [this extractor extension](https://github.com/hedronvision/bazel-compile-commands-extractor). Refer to instructions in the project README; it is intended for use with clangd. 
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">Other build systems, using Bear</summary>
[Bear](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear) is a tool to generate a
compile_commands.json file by recording a complete build.

For a `make`-based build, you can run `make clean; bear -- make` to generate the
file (and run a clean build!).
</details>

Other tools can also generate this file. See [the compile_commands.json
specification](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html).

### `compile_flags.txt`

If all files in a project use the same build flags, you can put those
flags one-per-line in `compile_flags.txt` in your source root.

Clangd will assume the compile command is `clang $FLAGS some_file.cc`.

Creating this file by hand is a reasonable place to start if your project is
quite simple. However background-indexing will not work, as clangd can't be
sure which of the files are project sources.

This file will be ignored if `compile_commands.json` is present.
