# The clangd index

The index stores information about the whole codebase. It's used to provide LSP
features where the AST of the current file doesn't have the information we need.

## Exposed data

- `Symbol`s are the primary objects managed by the index. A function, variable,
  class, or macro is a Symbol, and each one has an opaque `SymbolID`.
  Two declarations of the same thing will produce the same `SymbolID` and thus
  be merged into one `Symbol`.

  Symbols have names, declaration/definition locations, documentation, and a
  bunch of attributes used for code completion.

  They can be looked up by ID, or fuzzy-searched by name.

- `Ref`s are uses of a symbol in code, such as a call to a function.
  They are edges between a `Symbol` and a location in some file.

  They can be looked up by SymbolID.

- `Relation`s describe related symbols, such as a class that inherits another.
  They are edges between two `Symbol`s, labeled with a relation kind.

  They are looked up using one of the `Symbols` and the kind.

## Implementations

`SymbolIndex` is an interface, and clangd maintains several instances.
These are stitched together using `MergedIndex`, which layers one index on top
of another. Code implementing features sees only a single combined index.

### `FileIndex` ("dynamic index")

This is the top layer, and includes symbols from the files that have been opened
and the headers they include. This is used:

- to provide code completions for symbols at global scope in header files.
  (This is more efficient than deserializing big parts of the preamble).
- to ensure cross-references for the files you're working on are available, even
  if the background index hasn't finished yet
- to ensure locations of definitions/references aren't stale despite actively
  editing the file

The `FileIndex` class stores data from each file separately. When a file is
parsed, the TUScheduler invokes a callback which adds the AST to the index.
(In fact, there is a separate storage and callback for expensive-and-rare
preamble rebuilds vs cheap-and-frequent main-file rebuilds).

### `BackgroundIndex`

As the name suggests, this parses all files in the project in the background
to build a complete index. This is used:

- to ensure full coverage of the codebase
- to capture references inside template instantiations, which are disabled
  elsewhere in clangd for performance reasons

The `BackgroundIndex` maintains a thread-pool, and when a compilation database
is found, the compile command for each source file is placed on a queue.

Before indexing each file, the index checks for a cached `*.idx` file on disk.
After indexing, it writes this file. This avoids reindexing on startup if
nothing changed since last time.
These files are located in `.cache/clangd/index/` next to `compile_commands.json`.
For headers with no CDB, such as the standard library, they are in `clangd/index`
under the user's cache directory (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME`, `DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR`, or
`%LocalAppData%`).

### Static index

The (optional) static index is built outside clangd. It would typically cover
the whole codebase. This is used:

- to avoid waiting for the background index to build
- to allow the background index to be disabled for large projects, saving
  CPU/RAM/battery

With the `-index-file` option, clangd will load an index produced by the
`clangd-indexer` tool.

### Remote index

For large codebases (e.g. LLVM and Chromium) global index can take a long
time to build (multiple hours even on very powerful machines for Chrome-sized
projects) and induces a large memory overhead (multiple GB of RAM) to serve
within clangd.

Remote index allows serving index on a separate machine and connecting to it
from your device. This means you don't have to build the index yourself
anymore and clangd will use significantly less memory. Hence developers can
work from less powerful machines, while still using clangd to its fullest.
